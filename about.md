        <br/><br/>
        I’m Cong, you probably already saw it up there on the header. I am a multidisciplinary designer based in Saigon, Vietnam. I design and build front-end for websites, UX/UI designer for mobile app, print designer and occasionally typeface designer. Currently full time UX/UI designer and front-end developer <a class="primary-color" href="http://misfit.com" target="_blank">@misfit</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        My time is split between, company work during the day and personal work, reading or self-learning during the night. I am a coffee-enthusiast and extremely interested in specialty coffee of all kind. I have a coffee <a class="primary-color" href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">notebook</a> to record every cup. I love bicycle and used to race in alley cats around the city. I love to explore, places and things.
