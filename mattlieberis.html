    Matt Lieber Is is a tribute for my favourite podcast, Reply All from Gimlet Media, a show about the Internet. It is the kind of show that gives you astonishing, fascinating and surprising stories that you can’t help but falling in love with. But the true creativity lies in the smallest little details, and one of them is this line “Matt Lieber is ...” everytime at the end of an episode. It’s probably first started out as a Gimlet’s inside joke but then caught on, I’ve noticed this from the very beginning and can’t wait for it every time an episode is completed. I hope PJ and Alex will keep on producing this awesome show and even if one day they’ll stop and move on, I’ll always be your biggest fan.
    <br/><br/>
    About Matt, he’s a Gimlet cofounder. A cool guy whom I follow on Twitter and occasionally see this kind of tweet. Oh did I mention about this extremely white teeth?
    <br/><br/>
    Lastly, this project is comprised of almost all the saying from the podcast, with some of my own. ;) Enjoy!
