      Hi, my name is Cong.
      <br /><br />
      I am a designer and front-end developer, currently working at <a href="http://misfit.com" target="\_blank">Misfit Wearables</a>. Let‚Äôs get a little personal so you could know a little about me.
      <br /><br />
      Once upon a time, there was a guy studying Bachelor of Design at RMIT and he loved it. He then graduated with Honour among 18 others from his 2014 class. His classmates went on with their lives after the graduation, so did he. He then received a job offer into a <a href="http://floatingcube.com" target="\_blank">small tech startup company</a> building mobile apps, doing UI/UX design and it was great. With the fond of technology and the vision to change the world we‚Äôre living in, he worked hard. Paying attention to every single pixel, curating the best typefaces possible for each project and crafting the best experience for the products he was building.
      <br /><br />
      But that wasn‚Äôt enough, he thought.
      <br /><br />
      Let‚Äôs rewind back a decade before the graduation real quick, and it was 2005, in Saigon, Vietnam. The young boy was deconstructing a CD reader, pulling it all apart to see what was inside, then putting them together bit by bit, module by module, screw by screw. It was the love of exploring, learning and building the surrounding things that struck him.
      <br /><br />
      Now, ten years later he thought to himself that even though he could open up Sketch, building this wonderful UI but then it‚Äôs so dull, and static, nothing is happening and that‚Äôs no way to live. From that moment, he learned coding and that‚Äôs how the builder in him gives life to his work. Making it presentable, making it real and interactive.
      <br /><br />
      People has been telling him to choose a path, either coding or designing, but he chose both because he knows with his personalities, he would want to build something and stuck with it until the product is shipped or delivered. He loves to get involved, get his hands dirty whilst fixing and improving. He loves design and at the same time he wants to stay true to code. Because without one another, it‚Äôs just a plain-ole-boring pile of pixels or a badly crafted product.
      <br /><br />
      And there it is, my own little story for you to get to know me better. I‚Äôm always open up for works and/or collaborations. Don‚Äôt hesitate to shoot me an email. I promise I will reply and definitely never spam you.
      <br /><br />
      Anyways, thank you for reading it this far. Good day to you!
