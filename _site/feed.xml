        <title>Personal Portfolio</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;misfit-internal-tool__nav&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      I'll admit it. I was trying to be clever by going against all those ubiquitous portfolio sites with a fucking big-ass headline saying 'John Doe, designer based in Wonderland at your service!'. Basically a bunch of boring, bullshit headlines with big stock images behind them. Meh, thinking of it is making me sick already 😖. After my humble opening, medium-sized text is a bunch of jokes, going in a loop like a carousel. Some one emailed me saying that it was neath and a good idea after I test ran this design for a month back in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      But then I felt like it's too boring. It's not enough so I set out to do more. That's when this came out...
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      Minimal and filled with CSS animations giving it a good first time impression. But after a round of feedbacks from peers and my girlfriend. This style has to either go or be improved upon because it's too plain and not even special. Not showing my skill and the line of work I do. (Lesson learned: always listen to your girlfriend/fiance/wife. Haha. No seriously.)
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Then once again, think, think, think, do, do, do. And voila. Look at this.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      I moved from my favourite typeface of the year, Circular to Edmondsans because I was in love with the letter 'a' and 'g' (both lowercase). I added a sun, because I want to haha there was really no reasoning behind that. But basically, I wanted my site to look a little artistic, like my own little playground for creativity. It looks cool and hip, but is it practical? No. Maybe it's in trend now with the shifted text and up, down, right, left text setting direction but to let it stand the test of time I'd say it wouldn't last a year. And once again, my girlfriend said it's terrible. So here to go again. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      Boom, an updated version of the previous one. With the big and gigantic fucking sun moved to the left. Added some gradient picture effect I was interested in and was testing out. Some stupid fucking lines and boxes. Then some copies. Put everything in a single page layout from top to bottom (which is so 2010, by the way). Mixed it up, cooked for 30 minutes. And 'ting!', this shitty shit. I was so disappointed with the result. I went straigth to making another one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      I know, this is very different from the other ones. Why the sudden shift? I don't know. I wanted to explore some other options and style. But then this looked like a product showcase site for a startup. So no.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Again, back to the drawing board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      One last one. The one you're seeing right now. Yes, it has a minimal home page with just a headline. But I've carefully selected a new typeface. Carefully developed a grid and baseline system that works great for show casing purpose. I've removed all the unnecessary things. The site is fast, largely text based. And most importantly, it fits my personality. Someone might say it's too minimal and not creative. But it's the system developed and the content it's serving that making it creative. It's the carefully polishing layout and attention to detail that define an outstanding piece of design. Since hopefully this site is the site you're visiting from whenever you are so go ahead and explore it.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      One more thing, this site isn't even fucking responsive, because I don't fucking care, no one can view shit I've done on a tiny screen anyways. So fuck it, use your laptop or GTFO.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Bonus: I even considered making it a site with no content like this.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio-version-extra.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      It's been a long post so thank you for reading and good day to you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Misfit Internal Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;misfit-internal-tool__nav&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/misfit-internal-system/nav.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      The revamped navigation bar was a great improvement because it's clear and always visible. Together with its the toolbar underneath that would show information related to the specific views and quick action buttons and search field, the combo has tremendously improved the UX. According to the data and feedback from users, this change to the navigation made the app easier to navigate and features more accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Next thing that was a big change from the old system are these 'toasts' or 'flash cards' that would replace the old alert box existed in the old system. These flashcards are less intrusive and appear more professional and come with three different level, friendly (green), douchy (yellow) and bitchy (red). Yep, we actually called them like that. The design discussion would be: 'Show the app show the user how bitchy she could be?'
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/misfit-internal-system/toast.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/misfit-internal-system/list.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      Of course, a system to collect and analyse data would incorporate a bunch of lists. And the old list was archaic and ancient. It was ugly, it was hard to see, it was bad and last but not least it was &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; and I fucking hated it. So to make the lists consistent with other elements, I gave it a new look. Cleaner, larger means improve in legibility and with only important and relevant fields.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Lastly, one important improvement I've made to the app was prevent the use of modal. Of course, the most ubiquitous method of adding a piece of data into a list would be a modal popup, together with form inputs and a submit button. That was shitty and too intrusive. Plus it would introduce another different piece of UI element that the users need to learn to navigate. That's why I set out to change that. I've made the Add New view and the regular view similar, it's basically the same view, just with less information and the users will fill up by his/herself. The advantages are that the users are familiar with the layout, they know and recognize it, and subconsciously they are trained and used to the system. Another advantage is the fact that you don't have to make another UI element which would be ugly and require more development time. So win-win for all! You can check out the views below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/misfit-internal-system/normal-view.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/misfit-internal-system/add-new-view.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;content__body--text-post&quot;&gt;
      Because of the confidentiality of the projects, I couldn't show more, but hopefully this gave you a glimpse in the design process and best convey my design thinking and problem solving. This project was the foundation for changes in the Misfit internal tools design scene. From the elements designed here, it went on and being adapted to other apps, making everything &lt;b&gt;consistent&lt;/b&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      Slack introduced their emoji reaction back in July 2015 and I was fascinated by it. Thus, as a quick way to respond to an article, apart from like/heart and comment, user could use emoji as a way to represent their reactions. This could be a more creative way, which helps the user tell a more comprehensive story in less time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Condor Typeface</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Condor Typeface is created with one important goal, to celebrate the love for Vietnamese language. Condor is a side project I have quickly crafted after my trip away for a weekend, where I’ve encountered numerous vinage on abandoned and old buildings.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Vietnamese language is drifting far away from its aesthetic. I took the risk of stating that for a few reasons. Firstly, right now around the cities, hand painted signs from the pre-war period are disappearing. They are being replaced with digital printed canvas that was crafted using a world processor, sometimes vector based tools like Illustrator or Corel but just for the sake of getting-the-job-done. The quality is extremely bad. The aesthetic is missing. The layout is crooked. Good signage is heading toward becoming a lost art, a near extinct creature crippling in this society. Secondly, the places that has beautiful signage, carefully crafted branding, tend to not be in Vietnamese. They were Vietnamese stores, restaurants or event halls, but preferably chosen English or foreign language name. Talks’ve been spilled that the Vietnamese language with its diacritical marks usually an obstacle for beauty and asthetic. Lastly, combining the above reason, we have people either not care to use a product with Vietnamese writing on them or prefer not to include Vietnamese in their brands people they afraid no one will like it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s talk about the inspiration for this typeface. I visited Côn Đảo island back in June 2015. Côn Đảo is like Alcatraz, for those of you don’t know Alcatraz, it’s a prison, on an island, that doesn’t have civilian. Well, Côn Đảo was used before and during the wars in Vietnam, lasted for more than 100 years. During those years, rumours had it that the prisoners were treated terribly, without any sort of human rights. Then after the war it was abandoned and closed down by the government. Now the place is perfectly preserved of its former state and is opened for tourists from all over the war. I was not as fascinated with the stories there as with the signages found there. All of the old signage were in beautiful typograhy, the camp’s sign (i.e. Camp I, Camp II, etc.). And all of those were in Vietnamese, with beautifully crafted diacritical marks. It seems like before the war the people actually value this language. That was when I had the idea of designing a typeface from the signages I have found on Côn Đảo.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Condor is a display typeface. Its usage would suit most with signage because of its block letters, almost monospaced. The subtle contrast between stroke weight makes it legible when seeing a far and its spacious counter makes it less claustrophobic when put together. The diacritics are much thinner creating big contrast with the letter yet less obstrusive and still focus on the aesthetical form of the letters. The Condor is best when typeset on one line, usually a name of a brand or a place. But when shown in multiple lines, the typeface is possible to provide great visual depends on the creativity of your layout.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, Condor is still in its last phrase of developement and will probably be distributed for free soon. If you want to keep up to date with the progress, check back here often or shoot me an &lt;a class=&quot;primary-color&quot; href=&quot;mailto:me@congphamdesign.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and I will send out mass email when it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
