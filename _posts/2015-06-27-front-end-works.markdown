opening_content: "This is a collection of front-end development works that I've done during my employments. Apart from being a full time designer, I love to build stuff with my computer. And the closes to coding for me is web front-end development. All of the web pages/projects that I've done are mobile-friendly. Like most developers, I am capable of using many different front-end frameworks like Foundation, Bootstrap, React, etc.<br/><br/> Since I am a full-time designer and front-end developer at Misfit, this page will be constantly updated. Also, linked with most of the images below are the actual pages (except for the ones that were ran as short campaigns) so check them out for yourself.<br/><br/> Some of the works below were designed by me, all of them are crafted by me."
