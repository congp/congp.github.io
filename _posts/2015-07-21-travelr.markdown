      Slack introduced their emoji reaction back in July 2015 and I was fascinated by it. Thus, as a quick way to respond to an article, apart from like/heart and comment, user could use emoji as a way to represent their reactions. This could be a more creative way, which helps the user tell a more comprehensive story in less time.
