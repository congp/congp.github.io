  	<h1>Hey fellow Internet traveler!<br/>You are so lost!</h1>
    <p class="about__body--text">
    	I don't know how did you get here, but this is the land of the lost. Creatures here are clueless of their beings. They don't exist in the live form we all think they do. And that could happen to you! So beware, if you're staying here long enough, past the count down clock below this paragraph, that could happen to you!<br/><br/>
    	Hah! I lied, there was no timer, you're now a citizen of the land of the lost. Call your parents and say goodbye for one last time before you're lost...forever!
